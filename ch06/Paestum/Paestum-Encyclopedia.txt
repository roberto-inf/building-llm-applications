Paestum. Greek colony in Italy, south of Naples, of which a group of ruined Doric temples survives (c.530bcâ€“c.460 bc). This Doric Order has the most exaggerated entasis of any Antique example, and the very wide squat capitals on top of the shafts emphasize the primitive effect. The Paestum Order was much admired by Neo-Classical architects in C18 and C19, and was used where powerful effects were sought.
