The traditional interpretation among scholars suggests that Poseidonia came under the control of the Lucanians around 400 BC, leading to a supposed cultural change. However, recent research indicates that the transition to a Lucanian city was gradual and peaceful, with Greek practices continuing to be observed. The renaming of Poseidonia to Paistos or Paistom (later Paestum) may not necessarily indicate a conflict between Greeks and Lucanians, as it could have occurred under Roman rule.

The strong bonds with Rome, both politically and emotionally, led to Paestum's loyalty and support during times of conflict, ultimately earning the city a degree of autonomy and the privilege to mint its own coins. Despite Roman influence, Paestum retained elements of its Greek and Lucanian heritage.
