National Park of Cilento and Vallo di Diano [from deliciousitaly.com]

The National Park of Cilento and Vallo di Diano is located south of the Amalfi Coast and is more than worth a visit, or rather an exploration.

The word Cilento derives from the names of the rivers Sele and Alentum, but the area today is squeezed between the River Sele and the mountainous coastal fortifications running from Agropoli to Sapri and into the Diano interior.

The erosion of the chalk landscape over the centuries has left the territory rich in caves, cliffs and gorges. 

They maybe gorgeous these days, but were clearly a harsh place to live when transport was by donkey or foot.

Lorenzo Giustiniani in the late 1700's wrote of the town of Castinatelli:

"one of those wretched pitiable little lots that are seen scattered throughout Cilento inhabited by woebegone, grief stricken and dismal souls attached only to the intense labor of the land".

We hope he got out there alive!

The whole zone has been designated the Parco Nazionale del Cilento e Vallo di Diano since 1991 and here a few reference points followed by 5 itineraries.

Try first the Grottoes of Pertosa and Castelcivita, while the hamlets of Roscigno on the slopes of Mount Pruno and Centola San Severino are genuinely untouched, medieval treasures.

Worth visiting is the WWF Oasis of Persano, Montesano Terme and the unforgiving Alburni mountain plateau and the Carthusian Monastery of Padula.

This religious community was founded in 1084 in Grenoble, Switzerland and typically they offered hospitality to passing pilgrims, as well as making an income on medicinal herbs.

The town of Policastro is known for the Cathedral to where the monks escaped from Byzantine persecution and many rites still owe their origins to Greek custom.
