Casal Velino
Casal Velino is an historic village above the Mediterranean Sea along the beautiful Cilento Coast. It was established when the inhabitants of ancient Elea (Velia) sought refuge inland from the relentless Saracen raids, and later the scourges of malaria, on the higher ground. Various stone watch towers still dot the coastline and guard the village as testimony of the defensive nature of the towns.

The "modern" history of Casal Velino dates to 1063 when it was formally recognized as Casalicchio. The name then combined with Velia to form the current name. The ancient Greek and Roman ruins at Velia are especially noteworthy. The more recent fishing village of Marina Casal Velino has become a tourist destination for its clean beaches and azure waters. This stretch is one of the Cilento's real gems.

In the historic borgo you'll find charming stone alleys with old palaces and attractive homes. The narrow lanes open into small piazzas and are connected by stairways. The town fronts the sea and is backed by mountains, making it an ideal climate where abundant orchards thrive. There are silvery olive groves along with figs and other fruits, along with pine and myrtles. The lushly green hills tumble down to the sea, and the town enjoys fabulous views extending along the coastline.

The streets are fun to wander and the atmosphere is captivating. There are a few churches along the way, including Madonna del Carmelo and the nicely frescoed Madonna dell'Assunta. Borgo Casal Velino is perched at 170 meters above the sea. It's near the seaside resort towns of Palinuro and Acciaroli. Inland is the pristine National Park of the Cilento offering mountain activities and a variety of flora and fauna, as well as trails, hill towns and natural beauty.
