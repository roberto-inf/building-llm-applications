The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh – Kernow Festival that is held in Brandivy and Bignan (in Breizh/Bretagne – France) on the alternate years.       ( updated Jun 2023 ) \n",
      " Golowan , sometimes also  Goluan  or  Gol-Jowan  is the Cornish word for the Midsummer celebrations, most popular in the Penwith area and in particular  Penzance  and  Newlyn . The celebrations are conducted from the 23rd of June (St John's Eve) to the 28th of June (St Peter's Eve) each year, St Peter's Eve being the more popular in Cornish fishing communities. The celebrations are centred around the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. Some towns have a street-parade during this period. \n",

      " Nickanan Night  is traditionally held on the Monday before Lent. This event is an excuse for local youths to undertake acts of minor vandalism and play practical jokes on neighbours and family. The name Nickanan may come from the practice of knocking on doors and running away, known as 'Nick Nack' in some parts of the English-speaking world. The eating of pea soup and salt bacon is also associated with this date. \n",

      " Shrove Tuesday Hurling : \"Cornish hurling\" or \"silverball\" (Cornish:  Hyrlîan ) is a medieval game once common throughout Cornwall but now only played in  St Columb (Major)  and  St Ives . The St Columb's game takes place first on Pancake Day (moves around in February) and then again on the Saturday eleven days later. The game involves two teams of several hundred people (the 'townsmen' and the 'countrymen') who endeavour to carry a silver ball made of apple wood to goals set roughly two miles (3   km) apart, making the parish the largest pitch for a ball game anywhere in the world. The annual St. Ives hurling match happens on Feast Monday each February (the feast is on the Sunday nearest to February 3).  \n",

      " .   A Celtic cultural festival celebrating “All things” Cornish and Breton that takes place biennially (every two years) in Cornwall at Easter. The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh – Kernow Festival that is held in Brandivy and Bignan (in Breizh/Bretagne – France) on the alternate years.       ( updated Jun 2023 ) \n",
      " Golowan , sometimes also  Goluan  or  Gol-Jowan  is the Cornish word for the Midsummer celebrations, most popular in the Penwith area and in particular  Penzance  and  Newlyn . The celebrations are conducted from the 23rd of June (St John's Eve) to the 28th of June (St Peter's Eve) each year, St Peter's Eve being the more popular in Cornish fishing communities. The celebrations are centred around the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. Some towns have a street-parade during this period. \n",
      " Guldize  is an ancient harvest festival in Autumn, which involved the \"crying of the neck\" ritual of chanting in the corn field. A revived Guldize celebration is held in  Penzance , and in several other locations across Cornwall. \n",
      " Nickanan Night  is traditionally held on the Monday before Lent. This event is an excuse for local youths to undertake acts of minor vandalism and play practical jokes on neighbours and family. The name Nickanan may come from the practice of knocking on doors and running away, known as 'Nick Nack' in some parts of the English-speaking world. The eating of pea soup and salt bacon is also associated with this date. \n",

      " Shrove Tuesday Hurling : \"Cornish hurling\" or \"silverball\" (Cornish:  Hyrlîan ) is a medieval game once common throughout Cornwall but now only played in  St Columb (Major)  and  St Ives . The St Columb's game takes place first on Pancake Day (moves around in February) and then again on the Saturday eleven days later. The game involves two teams of several hundred people (the 'townsmen' and the 'countrymen') who endeavour to carry a silver ball made of apple wood to goals set roughly two miles (3   km) apart, making the parish the largest pitch for a ball game anywhere in the world. The annual St. Ives hurling match happens on Feast Monday each February (the feast is on the Sunday nearest to February 3).  \n",

      "  * **Tintagel Castle** legendary birthplace of the famous King Arthur and seat of the kings of Cornwall. Earl Richard of Cornwall and King of the Romans built the present medieval castle at the site. Ongoing excavations are revealing a Cornish royal seat of the period 400 to 700 AD.\n",

It is a grade-separated expressway as far as Carland Cross near Truro\\n(the expressway is expected to be open as far as Camborne (between Redruth and\\nHayle) by March 2024). You can also get to Cornwall via the A38, crossing the\\nRiver Tamar at Plymouth via the Tamar Bridge, which levies a toll on eastbound\\nvehicles. On summer Saturdays and during bank holiday weekends roads to\\nCornwall are usually busy.\\n\\n## Get around\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n### By bus\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThanks to Transport for Cornwall, all bus tickets are interchangeable across\\nthe different companies. The **Cornwall All Day ticket** allows unlimited\\ntravel for a calendar day. As of 2023, fares are £5 for adults and £4 for\\nunder-19s. Payment is by cash or contactless. The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines. For train times and fares\\nvisit National Rail Enquiries.\\n\\nThe **Cornwall Ranger** ticket allows unlimited train travel in Cornwall and\\nPlymouth for a calendar day.

It is a grade-separated expressway as far as Carland Cross near Truro\\n(the expressway is expected to be open as far as Camborne (between Redruth and\\nHayle) by March 2024).

The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines.

       " Document(metadata={'doc_id': '42b0c6bd-710d-457e-b6bd-3b4043903a08'}, page_content=\"Traveling to Cornwall can be done via train or car. Trains from London to Plymouth take approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes. By car, the A30 expressway provides access from Exeter through Devon and Cornwall to Land's End, with the route expected to improve further by March 2024. The A38 also connects Cornwall, but has a toll for eastbound traffic at the Tamar Bridge. Roads to Cornwall can be congested during summer Saturdays and bank holidays.\\n\\nWithin Cornwall, getting around is convenient by bus or train. Transport for Cornwall offers interchangeable bus tickets, including the Cornwall All Day ticket, which costs £5 for adults and £4 for under-19s, allowing unlimited travel in a day. Two main bus services are Go Cornwall Bus and Kernow. Train services are provided by CrossCountry Trains and Great Western Railway, with the Cornwall Ranger ticket available for unlimited train travel in Cornwall and Plymouth for £14 (adults) and £7 (under-16s).\\n\\nAttractions include the Eden Project near St Austell, the Lost Gardens of Heligan, and the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth. National Trust properties such as Antony House, Cotehele, Trelissick, and Glendurgan also offer beautiful gardens and historic settings for visitors to explore.\")]"

This airport (**ESH** IATA) is 5 miles (8 km) to the west of Brighton. It is the nearest airport for light aircraft and also offers sightseeing flights. However, there are no scheduled flights from here. This is the oldest licensed airport in the UK.

Beware the spelling of the similar-named **North Laine** (meaning\\n\"north fields\") which is a boutique and alternative shopping nirvana, to the\\nnorth side of North Street.\\n\\nWestern Road, a major shopping street runs east–west from the Clock Tower,\\nwhilst Eastern Road runs up a hill towards the main hospital from the area\\nknown as the **Old Steine** (rhymes with clean) which has Brighton Pier at the\\nseafront here.\\n\\nRunning north from the working Pier, you find the memorable **Royal Pavilion**\\n, a run down church St Peter\\'s, and The Level, which is being developed. Going\\nnorth east from here is Lewes Road (pronounced \"Lewis\") which takes you out to\\nthe city boundary and both of the Universities.\\n\\nHove is found to the west of Brighton. To the east of the city, there is\\nBrighton Marina.\\n\\n### By bike\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAlthough the area is hilly, cycling is a growing form of transport in\\nBrighton. The city council\\'s website has more details on cycling, including a\\nmap of routes.\\n\\nA cost effective way of getting around town \\'pay by the minute\\' ebike rental\\nservice, Beryl BTN Bikes, which has stations available across the city. It is\\noften the fastest way to move around, although the \\'resilient\\' bikes can be\\nchallenging on larger hills.\\n\\n### By bus\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nTwo Brighton and Hove buses, with the names \"Virginia Woolf\" and \"Levi Emanuel\\nCohen\" on the front of them. The bus company has a full list of the names used\\non their buses - see how many you can spot!\\n\\nBrighton and Hove Council have published a journey planner for local traffic.'),\n",
