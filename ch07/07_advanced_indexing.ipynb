It is a grade-separated expressway as far as Carland Cross near Truro\\n(the expressway is expected to be open as far as Camborne (between Redruth and\\nHayle) by March 2024). You can also get to Cornwall via the A38, crossing the\\nRiver Tamar at Plymouth via the Tamar Bridge, which levies a toll on eastbound\\nvehicles.

The **Cornwall All Day ticket** allows unlimited\\ntravel for a calendar day. As of 2023, fares are £5 for adults and £4 for\\nunder-19s. Payment is by cash or contactless. The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines. For train times and fares\\nvisit National Rail Enquiries.\\n\\nThe **Cornwall Ranger** ticket allows unlimited train travel in Cornwall and\\nPlymouth for a calendar day.

The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines.

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Brighton', 'title': 'Brighton – Travel guide at Wikivoyage', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='There are particular days of the year when it is **very much** inadvisable to\\ndrive into Brighton:\\n\\n  * The children\\'s parade day at the start of Brighton Festival. Usually the first Saturday in May. Many roads in the centre of Brighton are closed.\\n  * The day of the annual London to Brighton Bike Ride. This is on a Sunday in June - tens of thousands of cyclists plus their support vehicles are in the city, so many roads will be blocked or difficult to get across.\\n  * The parade day of the Brighton and Hove Pride week. Around the first Saturday of August. Many roads in the centre of Brighton and around the pier area are closed to all traffic, and diversionary routes are long and/or not built for heavy traffic. Gridlock often ensues on Pride Saturday.\\n  * The Brighton Marathon in early April, where many roads in the city are closed.\\n  * The first Sunday of November when the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run is held (unless, of course, you own a veteran car!)\\n  * Any summer\\'s day when the sun is shining and the whole of London decides to head to Brighton beach.\\n\\n### By bus\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n  * Brighton and Hove Buses is the main bus company in Brighton, and they run to Brighton from Eastbourne in the east (with routes 12, 12A, 12X or 13X) and Tunbridge Wells in the north (with routes 28, 29, 29B or 29X). Travel on Brighton & Hove Buses cost £2 per journey or £4 a day for travel within Brighton (Southwick - Newhaven - Lewes - this is called a CitySaver). There is also a NetworkSaver ticket for travel around the network for £6.50 a day. There are many discount fares (\"CentreFares\", online tickets) and tickets which cost more (Nightbuses: ranging from £2 for N7 and N25 to £5 for the N69). Children only receive a discount with a BusID.\\n  * The National Express coach route 025 from London Victoria travels via Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. Journey times to Brighton are roughly 1 hr 40 min from Heathrow and 30 min from Gatwick, offering a competitive alternative to the train. Indeed, this is the quickest way to get between Heathrow and Brighton by public transport. If travelling from Central London, don\\'t get the coach; the train is much quicker (under 1 hr) and the slight cost increase is worth every penny.\\n  * Stagecoach bus[dead link] services run to Brighton from Portsmouth, via Worthing, on service 700. It costs £6.30 for one day\\'s unlimited travel on this route.\\n  * Metrobus has \"hop-on, hop-off\" services which run from Haywards Heath (with routes 271 and 272), Ardingly (with route 272) and Three Bridges (with route 272). Tickets cost between £4 and £5.30 for these routes, and can be used on Brighton and Hove Buses too.\\n\\n### By plane\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe city\\'s proximity to London means Brighton is well served by airports.\\nBrighton can be reached from Gatwick by train in as little as 25 minutes\\n£9.80-£11.90, Jan 2023).'),\n",

There is a significant gay district in Kemp Town which\\nadds to the Bohemian atmosphere of the city.\\n\\nWhilst a day trip to Brighton, or even a long weekend, will offer activities\\nand culture for the visitor all year round, it is in the springtime that the\\ncity really starts coming to life, and May sees the return of two of the most\\npopular festivals, Brighton Festival and Festival Fringe (see the events\\nsection). In the summer Brighton truly flourishes, with residents and visitors\\nenjoying lazy days and beautiful sunsets on what is perhaps the city\\'s\\ngreatest asset, the more than 5 mi (8.0 km) stretch of shingle beach, facing\\nsouth onto the English Channel.\\n\\nFor those with working visas, Brighton is a good spot for seasonal and\\ntemporary work, due in part to its status as a student town and in part to it\\nbeing on the sea.\\n\\n### Local information\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n  * Brighton and Hove City Council website\\n\\n## Get in\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nView west along Brighton beach\\n\\n_Wikivoyage has a guide toRail travel in Great Britain_\\n\\nTrains to Brighton run from London Victoria and London Bridge stations in\\nLondon, taking about an hour (faster for the Brighton Express services from\\nVictoria, although expect to add another 20 minutes if travelling during peak\\ncommuting times).
