Ishmael arrives in New Bedford on a cold December night, where he chooses to stay at the Spouter Inn, characterized by its chaotic atmosphere and a mysterious painting of a whale attacking a ship. Here, he encounters a harpooneer named Queequeg, whose intimidating appearance initially frightens him. Despite his anxiety and unease about sharing a bed with Queequeg, who practices unique rituals, Ishmael eventually comes to see him as a human being and recognizes their developing bond. The narrative blends humor and existential reflection, setting the stage for the larger themes of the novel.\n"

Originally named Poseidonia, it flourished for two centuries as an autonomous Greek polis, complete with a defensive wall and several significant structures, including three renowned Doric temples dedicated to Hera and Athena. The city experienced intense cultural and commercial exchange with both Greek and non-Greek populations, such as the Etruscans and other Italic tribes.

The city is particularly noted for its well-preserved temples, dating from 550 to 450 BC: the Temple of Hera I (the so-called Basilica), the Temple of Athena (the so-called Temple of Ceres), and the Temple of Hera II (the so-called Temple of Neptune), with the latter being the best preserved.
