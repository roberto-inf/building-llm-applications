       " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Festivals'}, page_content='Festivals \\n [ edit ] \\n \\n These festivals tend to not be public holidays and not all are celebrated fully across the county. \\n   \\n AberFest \\n .   A Celtic cultural festival celebrating “All things” Cornish and Breton that takes place biennially (every two years) in Cornwall at Easter. The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh – Kernow Festival that is held in Brandivy and Bignan (in Breizh/Bretagne – France) on the alternate years.       ( updated Jun 2023 ) \\n Golowan , sometimes also  Goluan  or  Gol-Jowan  is the Cornish word for the Midsummer celebrations, most popular in the Penwith area and in particular  Penzance  and  Newlyn . The celebrations are conducted from the 23rd of June (St John\\'s Eve) to the 28th of June (St Peter\\'s Eve) each year, St Peter\\'s Eve being the more popular in Cornish fishing communities. The celebrations are centred around the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. Some towns have a street-parade during this period. \\n Guldize  is an ancient harvest festival in Autumn, which involved the \"crying of the neck\" ritual of chanting in the corn field. A revived Guldize celebration is held in  Penzance , and in several other locations across Cornwall. \\n Nickanan Night  is traditionally held on the Monday before Lent. This event is an excuse for local youths to undertake acts of minor vandalism and play practical jokes on neighbours and family. The name Nickanan may come from the practice of knocking on doors and running away, known as \\'Nick Nack\\' in some parts of the English-speaking world. The eating of pea soup and salt bacon is also associated with this date. \\n Noze looan  is a style of Cornish-Celtic dance, and associated music and events similar to the Breton Fest, Noz. Noze Looan is late Cornish for \"happy night\" \\n Picrous Day  is celebrated by the tin miners of Cornwall on the 2nd Thursday before Christmas. Luxulyan, 4 miles NE of  St Austell , hosts a particular big party. \\n Shrove Tuesday Hurling : \"Cornish hurling\" or \"silverball\" (Cornish:  Hyrlîan ) is a medieval game once common throughout Cornwall but now only played in  St Columb (Major)  and  St Ives . The St Columb\\'s game takes place first on Pancake Day (moves around in February) and then again on the Saturday eleven days later. The game involves two teams of several hundred people (the \\'townsmen\\' and the \\'countrymen\\') who endeavour to carry a silver ball made of apple wood to goals set roughly two miles (3 \\xa0 km) apart, making the parish the largest pitch for a ball game anywhere in the world. The annual St. Ives hurling match happens on Feast Monday each February (the feast is on the Sunday nearest to February 3).  \\n St Piran\\'s Day  (Cornish:  Gool Peran ) is the national day of Cornwall, held on 5 March every year. There is large parties widespread across the whole of Cornwall, with people dressing in the black, white and silver national colours.  \\n Tom Bawcock\\'s Eve : on 23rd December, stargazey pies are traditionally consumed. In mythology, pies were seen bizarrely as the reason the devil stayed out of Cornwall.'),\n",
