The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh – Kernow Festival that is held in Brandivy and Bignan (in Breizh/Bretagne – France) on the alternate years.       ( updated Jun 2023 ) \n",
      " Golowan , sometimes also  Goluan  or  Gol-Jowan  is the Cornish word for the Midsummer celebrations, most popular in the Penwith area and in particular  Penzance  and  Newlyn . The celebrations are conducted from the 23rd of June (St John's Eve) to the 28th of June (St Peter's Eve) each year, St Peter's Eve being the more popular in Cornish fishing communities. The celebrations are centred around the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. Some towns have a street-parade during this period. \n",

This event is an excuse for local youths to undertake acts of minor vandalism and play practical jokes on neighbours and family. The name Nickanan may come from the practice of knocking on doors and running away, known as 'Nick Nack' in some parts of the English-speaking world. The eating of pea soup and salt bacon is also associated with this date. \n",

The St Columb's game takes place first on Pancake Day (moves around in February) and then again on the Saturday eleven days later. The game involves two teams of several hundred people (the 'townsmen' and the 'countrymen') who endeavour to carry a silver ball made of apple wood to goals set roughly two miles (3   km) apart, making the parish the largest pitch for a ball game anywhere in the world. The annual St. Ives hurling match happens on Feast Monday each February (the feast is on the Sunday nearest to February 3).  \n",

The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines. For train times and fares\\nvisit National Rail Enquiries.\\n\\nThe **Cornwall Ranger** ticket allows unlimited train travel in Cornwall and\\nPlymouth for a calendar day. As of 2023, this costs £14 for adults and £7 for\\nunder-16s.\\n\\n## See\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe **Eden Project** , near St Austell, a fabulous collection of flora from\\nall over the planet housed in two space age transparent domes, and a massive\\nzip line.\\n\\nThe **Lost Gardens of Heligan** , near Mevagissey, 80 acres (32 hectares) of\\nstunning landscaped scenery with a huge complex of walled flower and vegetable\\ngardens.\\n\\nThe **National Maritime Museum** Falmouth is the home of the National Maritime\\nMuseum's small boat collection and other exhibits.\\n\\n### National Trust properties\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**Antony House** near Torpoint: an 18th-century house set within a magnificent\\nlandscape garden, still home to the Carew Pole family.\\n\\n**Cotehele - St Dominick** , near Saltash: an atmospheric Tudor house with\\nMedieval roots, a mill on a historic quay, a glorious garden with valley views\\nand an expansive estate to explore.\\n\\n**Trelissick, Feock** , near Truro, is welcoming house and garden set in an\\nestate with stunning maritime views and lovely woodland walks.\\n\\n**Glendurgan, Mawnan Smith** , near Falmouth, is a historic and exotic wooded\\nvalley garden leading down to the River Helford\\n\\n## Do\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe **South West Coast Path** runs along the coastline of Britain's south-west\\npeninsula. The Cornish section is supposed to be the most scenic (unless you\\ntalk to someone in Devon, in which case the Devon part is most scenic). It is\\nparticularly scenic around Penwith and the Lizard. The trail takes walkers to\\nbusy towns, remote cliffs, beaches, heaths, farms and fishing villages.\\nWalking along it is a great way to experience the region in all its variety.\\n(Walking the entire path takes several weeks, walking on a choice part of it\\nis easier.)\\n\\n**St Piran's Day** (Cornish: _Gool Peran_) is the national day of Cornwall,\\nheld on 5 March every year. There is large parties widespread across the whole\\nof Cornwall, with people dressing in the black, white and silver national\\ncolours.\")"

There is also a reputed **Beast of the Moor** , a large wild-cat that haunts and stalks at night, but is similar in fantasy to the Loch Ness Monster, in that no one can prove it exists, though sightings, theories and track-marks abound.\\n  * The **Eden Project** , near St Austell, a fabulous collection of flora from all over the planet housed in two 'space age' transparent domes.\\n  * The **Lost Gardens of Heligan** \\\\- near Mevagissey, 80 acres (32 hectares) of stunning landscaped scenery with a huge complex of walled flower and vegetable gardens\\n  * **Tintagel Castle** legendary birthplace of the famous King Arthur and seat of the kings of Cornwall. Earl Richard of Cornwall and King of the Romans built the present medieval castle at the site. Ongoing excavations are revealing a Cornish royal seat of the period 400 to 700 AD.\\n  * **Minack Theatre** is an outdoor theatre built by hand into the side of cliff over looking the ocean; between the villages of Porthcurno and St Levan, the theatre includes a museum and offers tours when there are no performances.\\n  * The **TateSt Ives**, one of the four Tate galleries in the UK - Modern Art\\n  * The **National Maritime Museum** Falmouth. Home of the National Maritime Museum's small boat collection and other exhibits.\\n  * **Mining heritage** is evident across the county in the remnants of former tin and copper mines as featured in the 1975 and 2015 TV adaptations of Winston Graham's _Poldark._ A large selection of Industrial Heritage attractions includes: Geevor Tin Mine, Poldark Mine, King Edward Mine and Crown Hill Mines, Botallack.\\n  * **Communication heritage** : due to its geographical location, the county formed the backdrop to major advancements in communication. Visitor sites are The Marconi Centre and the Telegraph Museum at Porthcurno. Rising above the Lizard Peninsula can also be seen the large dishes that form part of the Goonhilly Satellite Earth station.\\n\\n### National Trust properties\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n  * **Antony House** near Torpoint: an 18th-century house set within a magnificent landscape garden, still home to the Carew Pole family.\\n  * **St Michael's Mount** , Marazion, near Penzance: a rocky island crowned by medieval church and castle, home to a living community.\\n  * **Cotehele - St Dominick** , near Saltash: an atmospheric Tudor house with Medieval roots, a mill on a historic quay, a glorious garden with valley views and an expansive estate to explore.\\n  * **Godrevy - Gwithian** , near Hayle: stunning mix of long sandy beaches, high cliffs, and smugglers coves.\")"

It is a grade-separated expressway as far as Carland Cross near Truro\\n(the expressway is expected to be open as far as Camborne (between Redruth and\\nHayle) by March 2024). You can also get to Cornwall via the A38, crossing the\\nRiver Tamar at Plymouth via the Tamar Bridge, which levies a toll on eastbound\\nvehicles. On summer Saturdays and during bank holiday weekends roads to\\nCornwall are usually busy.\\n\\n### By plane\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n50.440833-4.9952781 Cornwall Airport (**NQY** IATA) in Newquay is the main\\nairport for the county, with year-round flights only from Aberdeen, Alicante,\\nDublin, London Gatwick, and Manchester. During the summer season, more flights\\narrive from a wider range of UK and EU airports.\\n\\n## Get around\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n### By bus\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThanks to Transport for Cornwall, all bus tickets are interchangeable across\\nthe different companies. The **Cornwall All Day ticket** allows unlimited\\ntravel for a calendar day. As of 2023, fares are £5 for adults and £4 for\\nunder-19s. Payment is by cash or contactless. The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines. For train times and fares\\nvisit National Rail Enquiries. The **Cornwall Ranger** ticket allows unlimited\\ntrain travel in Cornwall and Plymouth for a calendar day. As of 2023, this\\ncosts £14 for adults and £7 for under-16s.\\n\\n## See\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nWithin the 208 km2 of the Bodmin Moor, is **King Arthur's Hall** , a\\nmegalithic monument and **Brown Willy** , the highest point in Cornwall at 417\\nm (1,368 ft). **Dozmary Pool** is a small beautiful lake where, according to\\nlegend, King Arthur was entrusted with the sword Excalibur. There is also a\\nreputed **Beast of the Moor** , a large wild-cat that haunts and stalks at\\nnight, but is similar in fantasy to the Loch Ness Monster, in that no one can\\nprove it exists, though sightings, theories and track-marks abound.\\n\\n**Tintagel Castle** is the legendary birthplace of King\\n\\nTintagel Castle, legendry birthplace of King Arthur\\n\\nArthur and seat of the kings of Cornwall. Earl Richard of Cornwall and King of\\nthe Romans built the present medieval castle at the site. Ongoing excavations\\nare revealing a Cornish royal seat of the period 400 to 700 AD.\\n\\n**Pencarrow House and Gardens** is a large house near Wadebridge built in 1760\\nwith extensive gardens.\\n\\n**Prideaux Place** is a large house near Padstow.\"),\n",

It is sometimes called \"London-\\nby-the-Sea\" for this reason. Brighton is typically referred to as the gay\\ncapital of Britain. There is a significant gay district in Kemp Town which\\nadds to the Bohemian atmosphere of the city.\\n\\nWhilst a day trip to Brighton, or even a long weekend, will offer activities\\nand culture for the visitor all year round, it is in the springtime that the\\ncity really starts coming to life, and May sees the return of two of the most\\npopular festivals, Brighton Festival and Festival Fringe (see the events\\nsection). In the summer Brighton truly flourishes, with residents and visitors\\nenjoying lazy days and beautiful sunsets on what is perhaps the city\\'s\\ngreatest asset, the more than 5 mi (8.0 km) stretch of shingle beach, facing\\nsouth onto the English Channel.\\n\\nFor those with working visas, Brighton is a good spot for seasonal and\\ntemporary work, due in part to its status as a student town and in part to it\\nbeing on the sea.\\n\\n### Local information\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n  * Brighton and Hove City Council website\\n\\n## Get in\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nView west along Brighton beach\\n\\n_Wikivoyage has a guide toRail travel in Great Britain_\\n\\nTrains to Brighton run from London Victoria and London Bridge stations in\\nLondon, taking about an hour (faster for the Brighton Express services from\\nVictoria, although expect to add another 20 minutes if travelling during peak\\ncommuting times).

In 1997, the district of Brighton\\nmerged with Hove to form the **City of Brighton and Hove** which was given\\ncity status in 2001.\\n\\nBrighton is known for its grand Regency architecture, several landmarks in an\\noriental-inspired architectural style including the Grade-I Listed Pavilion,\\nand for its large LGBT community.\\n\\n## Understand\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nBrighton Seafront\\n\\nBrighton was a sleepy little fishing village, then known as\\n**Brighthelmstone** , until Dr Richard Russell of Lewes began to prescribe the\\nuse of seawater for his patients. He advocated the drinking of seawater and\\nsea-bathing in 1750. In 1753 he erected a large house near the beach for\\nhimself and for his patients. A further factor in Brighton's growth came in\\nthe early 19th century when the Prince of Wales built the Royal Pavilion, an\\nextravagant Regency building designed by John Nash. But it was only with the\\ndevelopment of the railways, around 1840, that Brighton truly started to boom.\"),\n",

Usually the first Saturday in May. Many roads in the centre of Brighton are closed.\\n  * The day of the annual London to Brighton Bike Ride. This is on a Sunday in June - tens of thousands of cyclists plus their support vehicles are in the city, so many roads will be blocked or difficult to get across.\\n  * The parade day of the Brighton and Hove Pride week. Around the first Saturday of August. Many roads in the centre of Brighton and around the pier area are closed to all traffic, and diversionary routes are long and/or not built for heavy traffic. Gridlock often ensues on Pride Saturday.\\n  * The Brighton Marathon in early April, where many roads in the city are closed.\\n  * The first Sunday of November when the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run is held (unless, of course, you own a veteran car!)\\n  * Any summer\\'s day when the sun is shining and the whole of London decides to head to Brighton beach.\\n\\n### By bus\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n  * Brighton and Hove Buses is the main bus company in Brighton, and they run to Brighton from Eastbourne in the east (with routes 12, 12A, 12X or 13X) and Tunbridge Wells in the north (with routes 28, 29, 29B or 29X). Travel on Brighton & Hove Buses cost £2 per journey or £4 a day for travel within Brighton (Southwick - Newhaven - Lewes - this is called a CitySaver). There is also a NetworkSaver ticket for travel around the network for £6.50 a day. There are many discount fares (\"CentreFares\", online tickets) and tickets which cost more (Nightbuses: ranging from £2 for N7 and N25 to £5 for the N69). Children only receive a discount with a BusID.\\n  * The National Express coach route 025 from London Victoria travels via Heathrow and Gatwick Airports. Journey times to Brighton are roughly 1 hr 40 min from Heathrow and 30 min from Gatwick, offering a competitive alternative to the train. Indeed, this is the quickest way to get between Heathrow and Brighton by public transport. If travelling from Central London, don\\'t get the coach; the train is much quicker (under 1 hr) and the slight cost increase is worth every penny.\\n  * Stagecoach bus[dead link] services run to Brighton from Portsmouth, via Worthing, on service 700. It costs £6.30 for one day\\'s unlimited travel on this route.\\n  * Metrobus has \"hop-on, hop-off\" services which run from Haywards Heath (with routes 271 and 272), Ardingly (with route 272) and Three Bridges (with route 272). Tickets cost between £4 and £5.30 for these routes, and can be used on Brighton and Hove Buses too.\\n\\n### By plane\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe city\\'s proximity to London means Brighton is well served by airports.\\nBrighton can be reached from Gatwick by train in as little as 25 minutes\\n£9.80-£11.90, Jan 2023).'),\n",
