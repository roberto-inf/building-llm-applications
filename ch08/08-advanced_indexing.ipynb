The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh – Kernow Festival that is held in Brandivy and Bignan (in Breizh/Bretagne – France) on the alternate years.       ( updated Jun 2023 ) \n",
      " Golowan , sometimes also  Goluan  or  Gol-Jowan  is the Cornish word for the Midsummer celebrations, most popular in the Penwith area and in particular  Penzance  and  Newlyn . The celebrations are conducted from the 23rd of June (St John's Eve) to the 28th of June (St Peter's Eve) each year, St Peter's Eve being the more popular in Cornish fishing communities. The celebrations are centred around the lighting of bonfires and fireworks and the performance of associated rituals. Some towns have a street-parade during this period. \n",

This event is an excuse for local youths to undertake acts of minor vandalism and play practical jokes on neighbours and family. The name Nickanan may come from the practice of knocking on doors and running away, known as 'Nick Nack' in some parts of the English-speaking world. The eating of pea soup and salt bacon is also associated with this date. \n",

The St Columb's game takes place first on Pancake Day (moves around in February) and then again on the Saturday eleven days later. The game involves two teams of several hundred people (the 'townsmen' and the 'countrymen') who endeavour to carry a silver ball made of apple wood to goals set roughly two miles (3   km) apart, making the parish the largest pitch for a ball game anywhere in the world. The annual St. Ives hurling match happens on Feast Monday each February (the feast is on the Sunday nearest to February 3).  \n",

The **Cornwall All Day ticket** allows unlimited\\ntravel for a calendar day. As of 2023, fares are £5 for adults and £4 for\\nunder-19s. Payment is by cash or contactless. The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines. For train times and fares\\nvisit National Rail Enquiries.\\n\\nThe **Cornwall Ranger** ticket allows unlimited train travel in Cornwall and\\nPlymouth for a calendar day. As of 2023, this costs £14 for adults and £7 for\\nunder-16s.\\n\\n## See\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe **Eden Project** , near St Austell, a fabulous collection of flora from\\nall over the planet housed in two space age transparent domes, and a massive\\nzip line.\\n\\nThe **Lost Gardens of Heligan** , near Mevagissey, 80 acres (32 hectares) of\\nstunning landscaped scenery with a huge complex of walled flower and vegetable\\ngardens.\\n\\nThe **National Maritime Museum** Falmouth is the home of the National Maritime\\nMuseum's small boat collection and other exhibits.\\n\\n### National Trust properties\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**Antony House** near Torpoint: an 18th-century house set within a magnificent\\nlandscape garden, still home to the Carew Pole family.\\n\\n**Cotehele - St Dominick** , near Saltash: an atmospheric Tudor house with\\nMedieval roots, a mill on a historic quay, a glorious garden with valley views\\nand an expansive estate to explore.\\n\\n**Trelissick, Feock** , near Truro, is welcoming house and garden set in an\\nestate with stunning maritime views and lovely woodland walks.\\n\\n**Glendurgan, Mawnan Smith** , near Falmouth, is a historic and exotic wooded\\nvalley garden leading down to the River Helford\\n\\n## Do\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe **South West Coast Path** runs along the coastline of Britain's south-west\\npeninsula. The Cornish section is supposed to be the most scenic (unless you\\ntalk to someone in Devon, in which case the Devon part is most scenic). It is\\nparticularly scenic around Penwith and the Lizard. The trail takes walkers to\\nbusy towns, remote cliffs, beaches, heaths, farms and fishing villages.\\nWalking along it is a great way to experience the region in all its variety.\\n(Walking the entire path takes several weeks, walking on a choice part of it\\nis easier.)\\n\\n**St Piran's Day** (Cornish: _Gool Peran_) is the national day of Cornwall,\\nheld on 5 March every year. There is large parties widespread across the whole\\nof Cornwall, with people dressing in the black, white and silver national\\ncolours.\")"

The **Cornwall All Day ticket** allows unlimited\\ntravel for a calendar day. As of 2023, fares are £5 for adults and £4 for\\nunder-19s. Payment is by cash or contactless. The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines. For train times and fares\\nvisit National Rail Enquiries.\\n\\nThe **Cornwall Ranger** ticket allows unlimited train travel in Cornwall and\\nPlymouth for a calendar day. As of 2023, this costs £14 for adults and £7 for\\nunder-16s.\\n\\n## See\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe **Eden Project** , near St Austell, a fabulous collection of flora from\\nall over the planet housed in two space age transparent domes, and a massive\\nzip line.\\n\\nThe **Lost Gardens of Heligan** , near Mevagissey, 80 acres (32 hectares) of\\nstunning landscaped scenery with a huge complex of walled flower and vegetable\\ngardens.\\n\\nThe **National Maritime Museum** Falmouth is the home of the National Maritime\\nMuseum's small boat collection and other exhibits.\\n\\n### National Trust properties\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**Antony House** near Torpoint: an 18th-century house set within a magnificent\\nlandscape garden, still home to the Carew Pole family.\\n\\n**Cotehele - St Dominick** , near Saltash: an atmospheric Tudor house with\\nMedieval roots, a mill on a historic quay, a glorious garden with valley views\\nand an expansive estate to explore.\\n\\n**Trelissick, Feock** , near Truro, is welcoming house and garden set in an\\nestate with stunning maritime views and lovely woodland walks.\\n\\n**Glendurgan, Mawnan Smith** , near Falmouth, is a historic and exotic wooded\\nvalley garden leading down to the River Helford\\n\\n## Do\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe **South West Coast Path** runs along the coastline of Britain's south-west\\npeninsula. The Cornish section is supposed to be the most scenic (unless you\\ntalk to someone in Devon, in which case the Devon part is most scenic). It is\\nparticularly scenic around Penwith and the Lizard. The trail takes walkers to\\nbusy towns, remote cliffs, beaches, heaths, farms and fishing villages.\\nWalking along it is a great way to experience the region in all its variety.\\n(Walking the entire path takes several weeks, walking on a choice part of it\\nis easier.)\\n\\n**St Piran's Day** (Cornish: _Gool Peran_) is the national day of Cornwall,\\nheld on 5 March every year. There is large parties widespread across the whole\\nof Cornwall, with people dressing in the black, white and silver national\\ncolours.\")"

It is a grade-separated expressway as far as Carland Cross near Truro\\n(the expressway is expected to be open as far as Camborne (between Redruth and\\nHayle) by March 2024). You can also get to Cornwall via the A38, crossing the\\nRiver Tamar at Plymouth via the Tamar Bridge, which levies a toll on eastbound\\nvehicles. On summer Saturdays and during bank holiday weekends roads to\\nCornwall are usually busy.\\n\\n## Get around\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n### By bus\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThanks to Transport for Cornwall, all bus tickets are interchangeable across\\nthe different companies. The **Cornwall All Day ticket** allows unlimited\\ntravel for a calendar day. As of 2023, fares are £5 for adults and £4 for\\nunder-19s. Payment is by cash or contactless. The two main bus companies are:\\n\\n  * **Go Cornwall Bus** covers all parts of Cornwall and connects with Plymouth (in Devon).\\n  * **Kernow** (part of First Bus) covers western and central Cornwall.\\n\\nBuses only serve designated stops when in towns; otherwise, you can flag them\\ndown anywhere that's safe for them to stop.\\n\\n### By train\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n**CrossCountry Trains** and **Great Western Railway** operate regular train\\nservices between the main centres of population, the latter company also\\nserving a number of other towns on branch lines.
